- 👋 Hi, I’m @austinmcelderry95
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to create applications from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I'd like to get into more Python, C++ and Java development, eventually learn some SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that fit my interest! Running, video games, data analytics. I'm a number nerd.
